# Animals-10 Classification with CNN

This project uses the Animals-10 dataset to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-class image classification.

## 📁 Dataset
- 10 animal classes
- Preprocessed and split into train / val / test sets
- Folder names translated from Italian to English

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU
- MaxPooling + Dropout
- Fully connected layers (256 → 10)
- Softmax output
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🚀 How to run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run cells step-by-step (data preprocessing, model training, evaluation)
3. Optionally upload to GitHub
